A python program is built such that it will index a set of documents and a function is written to search the query through these documents.
Indexing of files: 
1) Words in each text file is converted to lower case.
2) Stop words are removed.
3) A dictionary is built for each word with key being file name and value frequency (number of times the word appears in that particular file).
4) Firing a query: word is searched across each document and frequency is shown.
