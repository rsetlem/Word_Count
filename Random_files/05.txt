So first of all I just want to say that in my view the equity analogy is incomplete Especially if doing a blockchain or token in the US to be compliant with all regulations you need it to have a utility component and not just use it as a proxy for equities This is not too hard to do as there are so many interesting things you can do with tokenized networks So while I wont be a stickler in every point in this interview for making that distinction its a very important one to keep in mind you want to work with your lawyers to ensure that tokens or blockchain-based assets in general arent equities With that said relative to existing secondary markets in either property (like houses) or equities the scale of what is happening with the token market is unparalleled Its one thing to have a bunch of small secondary markets its quite another to turn the internet itself into a market Anyone with an internet connection can purchase a token See shapeshiftio for a great example of this
